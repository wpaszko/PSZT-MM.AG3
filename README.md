Genetic algorithm that divides N cards into two stacks, 
where sum of cards on first stack is closest to A 
and product of cards on second stack is closest to B.

Usage:

```
python algorithm.py [-s S] [-p P] N A B
```

* N - number of cards
* A - goal of first stack
* B - goal of second stack
* S (optional) - satisfactory matching level
* P (optional) - population size
